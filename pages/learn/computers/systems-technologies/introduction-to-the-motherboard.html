			<h1>Introduction To The Motherboard</h1>
			<p>
				I will be taking apart this PC to show you examples of what each part
				is. Please be warned if you are following along at home, if you have
				little experience with computer internals, I would recommend following
				along with an old or broken computer instead - or simply just watching
				the video
			</p>

		<main class="container main">
			<h2>Motherboard</h2>
			<p>
				This is pretty much a large circuit board with all the required slots
				and connectors for all your computer components, such as the RAM and
				CPU. It ensures that all the components of the computer can talk to each
				other, for example the CPU can communicate with the RAM to store data
				temporarily. It also distributes power to the parts connected to it.
				Each part or component is also known as a module. You can swap out
				modules, for example replacing the RAM or storage on the device, this is
				considered modular design, it has many benefits, such as when a
				component breaks, you can simply swap it out for a new one, or if you
				want to upgrade the computer, it would be the same process of just
				swapping it out for something new. It does come with down sides however,
				companies such as Apple will ship their Macbooks with a non-modular
				motherboard design, this can either help shrink the form factor to help
				the laptop stay small in size, or even improve overall performance, but
				at the cost of repairability and upgradeability.
			</p>

			<h2>ZIF Socket</h2>
			<p>
				The Zero Insertion Force or for short, the ZIF socket is where we
				connect the Central Processing Unit, the CPU for short, to the
				motherboard. You'll notice on the side it has a little clamp, this is
				used to insert or remove the CPU without damaging its connectors. The
				CPU connectors are incredibly fragile, so when building your own PC,
				make sure to not force it into the socket, as it can bend or damage the
				connectors. We'll talk more about the CPU and its functions in future
				videos.
			</p>

			<p>
				The CPU does most of the work on in a computer, this includes fetching
				data and instructions from the RAM, decoding, executing and transferring
				the data back to the RAM.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>DIMM Slots</h2>
			<p>
				Dual Inline Memory Modules or DIMMs for short are the memory sticks or
				RAM (Random Access Memory) as most people call it, that you add to your
				computer. You may also come across SO-DIMMs in the wild, those are
				usually smaller and are often used in Laptops and other smaller devices.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>SATA Connectors</h2>
			<p>
				These connectors allow you to plug in your storage devices, such as
				Solid State Drives (SSDs) and Hard Drives (HDD) into your Motherboard.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>Expansion Slots</h2>
			<p>
				These slots expand your computer so it can connect more circuits, or in
				simpler form for the video "Motherboards" to your Motherboard. They are
				mainly used for Graphics Cards these days.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>ROM</h2>
			<p>
				ReadOnly Memory is storage that, as the name suggestions, can only be
				read from but not written to. It holds any data stored in it, even when
				the power is turned off. It can be found on pretty much all electronic
				devices, as it keeps what is called the "firmware". Firmware is code
				that provides low-level control of hardware. You may also know it as the
				Basic Input Output System (BIOS), EFI or UEFI.
			</p>

			<p>
				The firmware is what tells your computer to how to start itself. One of
				the important things it does is the Power On Self Test, or POST, which
				checks that all the important hardware such as RAM and Hard Drives are
				working. If you ever messed around with your PC hardware, you may have
				heard beeps when something is wrong, these beeps usually indicate what
				is wrong, such as the RAM not being properly placed. The BIOS also
				provides a menu to configure your computer, such as set which drive
				should be booted first so it can locate and load the operating system,
				or giving you the options to overclock your system.
				<!-- EDITOR NOTE: Film your BIOS screen, or flash a couple of screenshots -->
			</p>

			<p>
				You might be wondering, if the ROM can not be written to, how can we
				save changes made in the BIOS menu? That is where CMOS, or Complementary
				Metal Oxide Semiconductor, comes in. All BIOS settings are stored there,
				that is why when you remove the CMOS Battery, you will reset your BIOS
				and it will use its default settings again, since the CMOS will lose
				power if it does not have a battery to keep the data safe.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is possible to update your firmware, which can lead to benefits of
				making your system work faster or adding new features to the device.
				Modern systems use EEPRIM (Erasable Programmable ROM), which can be
				erased electronically, and a new firmware can be saved to it. Doing this
				is also known as "flashing the ROM". This process can be very fragile,
				if it is interrupted or left incomplete during an update, the firmware
				may become corrupted and the system may not be able to work again. Many
				modern computer motherboards however does include ways to restore broken
				firmware.
