			<h1>Introduction To The Motherboard</h1>
			<p>
				I will be taking apart this PC to show you examples of what each part
				is. Please be warned if you are following along at home, if you have
				little experience with computer internals, I would recommend following
				along with an old or broken computer instead - or simply just watching
				the video
			</p>

			<h2>Motherboard</h2>
			<p>
				This is pretty much a large circuit board with all the required slots
				and connectors for all your computer components, such as the RAM and
				CPU. It ensures that all the components of the computer can talk to each
				other, for example the CPU can communicate with the RAM to store data
				temporarily. It also distributes power to the parts connected to it.
				Each part or component is also known as a module. You can swap out
				modules, for example replacing the RAM or storage on the device, this is
				considered modular design, it has many benefits, such as when a
				component breaks, you can simply swap it out for a new one, or if you
				want to upgrade the computer, it would be the same process of just
				swapping it out for something new. It does come with down sides however,
				companies such as Apple will ship their Macbooks with a non-modular
				motherboard design, this can either help shrink the form factor to help
				the laptop stay small in size, or even improve overall performance, but
				at the cost of repairability and upgradeability.

			<h2>ZIF Socket</h2>
			<p>
				The Zero Insertion Force or for short, the ZIF socket is where we
				connect the Central Processing Unit, the CPU for short, to the
				motherboard. You'll notice on the side it has a little clamp, this is
				used to insert or remove the CPU without damaging its connectors. The
				CPU connectors are incredibly fragile, so when building your own PC,
				make sure to not force it into the socket, as it can bend or damage the
				connectors. We'll talk more about the CPU and its functions in future
				videos.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>DIMM Slots</h2>
			<p>
				Dual Inline Memory Modules or DIMMs for short are the memory sticks or
				RAM (Random Access Memory) as most people call it, that you add to your
				computer. You may also come across SO-DIMMs in the wild, those are
				usually smaller and are often used in Laptops and other smaller devices.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>SATA Connectors</h2>
			<p>
				These connectors allow you to plug in your storage devices, such as
				Solid State Drives (SSDs) and Hard Drives (HDD) into your Motherboard.
			</p>
			<hr />

			<h2>Expansion Slots</h2>
			<p>
				These slots expand your computer so it can connect more circuits, or in
				simpler form for the video "Motherboards" to your Motherboard. They are
				mainly used for Graphics Cards these days.
